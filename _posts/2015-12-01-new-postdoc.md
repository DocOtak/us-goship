We recently learned some ipsum:

Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? 
Not if I weaken first. Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training.
Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Wait a 
minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Mr. Worf, 
you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister.
Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. 
Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches...
and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion? I will obey your orders. I will 
serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will 
die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. What's
a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? For an
android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. And blowing 
into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once.

They were just sucked into space. A lot of things can change in twelve years,
Admiral. Travel time to the nearest starbase? I recommend you don't fire until
you're within 40,000 kilometers. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first
duty is to the ship.
