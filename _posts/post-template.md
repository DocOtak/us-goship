## Creating a new "New & Updates" post (also outreach)

1. Copy this file and name it in the format "YYYY-MM-DD-post-title.md" (see other files in the _posts dir for examples).
   Where YYYY-MM-DD is a date in ISO 8601 format and the post title words are seperated by dashes.
2. Replace the contents of the title with your title (inside the qutoes).
3. Set the date above to what you want, it's also ISO 8601 format, can include a time.
4. Replace the contents of everything (that is, this stuff) after the three dashes `---` with your post content.
   [standard markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is preferred, but you can use raw HTML if you want.
